        <p> Wise men say </p>
        <p> Only fools rush in love </p>
        <p> But I can't help falling in love with you </p>

        <p> If I can't help falling in love with you? </p> <!-- PLease let us use the <br> tag, I can't help but fall in love with it -->

        <p>Like a river flows</p>
        <p>Surely to the sea</p>
        <p> Darling, so it goes </p>
